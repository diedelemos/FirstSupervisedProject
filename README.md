# SupervisedProject

Project for the Machine Learning class at Universidad de Navarra in december 2022.

In this project I built different models that predict the salary of different professionals, such as a Data Analyst, Data Engineer a Data Scientist, etc. I also compared the differrent models to see which one predicts better the salaries.

Also it was my first ever machine learning project.
